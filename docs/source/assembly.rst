Assembly
=======

At the time when I received my kit assembly documentation was spare and scattered around several places. I did not notice that the servos has different cable length with the result that I had to disassemble the robot again to get the servos in the right place.

An updated version of the documentation is `here <https://mangdang-minipupperdocs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html>`_ and is also updated quite frequently. I assume people following these instructions will not face the same issues than I did.

Overall assembly of the robot took a few hours but I considered it as a fun activity.

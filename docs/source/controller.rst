Controller
==========

This repository contains code that replaces the joystick controller from MangDang by a ROS2 based joystick controller but then passes joy messages to the MandDang controller. The robot should behave as with the original software but should solve connection issues with some of the PS4 controllers.

See future plans for more details on controllers.

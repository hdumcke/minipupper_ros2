Mini Pupper is a derivate of Stanford Pupper and the kit is produced by `MangDang Technology Co <https://www.mangdang.net>`_.

I supported their campaign on Indiegogo and received my kit end of January 2020. The kit came in a nice package and included all pieces to assemble the robot including screws and some tools.

The kit also included some 3D printed parts and some of those I have received were of poor quality. I am confident that this will improve as the product matures.
